    "# **Working of Tesseract**\n",
    "\n",
    "Before Tesseract reads a single letter, it must understand the \"geometry\" of the page. This is handled by a library called `Leptonica` and Tesseract's internal layout engine.\n",
    "\n",
    "Modern `Tesseract` OCR engine is i.e. `V4` or `V5` combines `Old School Computer Vision` techniques with `LSTM` based `Deep Learning` models.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Phase 1:**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Adaptive Thresholding / Binarization**\n",
    "\n",
    "First, the image is pre-processed using various techniques like `Binarization`, `Noise Removal`, `Skew Correction`, etc. to enhance the quality of the image for better text recognition.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tesseract does not read color or grayscale images directly. It converts everything to Binary (Black and White).\n",
    "\n",
    "**How it works:**\n",
    "\n",
    "It doesn't just say \"Anything darker than 50% is black.\" It uses `Local Adaptive Thresholding`. It looks at a small window of pixels. If a pixel is significantly darker than its neighbors, it becomes black (text).\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Connected Component Analysis (Blob Finding)**\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the image is `Binarized`, Tesseract looks for groups of connected black pixels called `Blobs`. Each blob could be a part of a letter, a whole letter, or even multiple letters stuck together.\n",
    "\n",
    "- A `Blob` is a group of connected pixels that are all the same color (in this case, black).\n",
    "\n",
    "- In `English`, the letter `i` might be split into two blobs: the dot and the stem. In `Devanagari`, the `Top Line (Shirorekha)` connects multiple letters into a single blob.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Page Layout Analysis (PLA)**\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the most complex non-AI part. Tesseract tries to find the structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Tab Stop Detection`: It looks for vertical alignments of text to identify columns and tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Gutter Detection`: It looks for `Horizontal Spaces` between blocks of text to separate paragraphs.\n",
    "\n",
    "`Tesseract` has hard-coded thresholds for how much white space constitutes a `Pagaraph Break` or a `Column Break`. So if `Nepali` text has a large font size or smaller line height, it might misinterpret the layout.\n",
    "\n",
    "In such cases, we've to manually calculate the `Gaps` and set the `Page Segmentation Mode (PSM)` accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Line Finding and Baseline Estimation**\n",
    "\n",
    "`Tesseract` groups blobs into lines of text. It estimates the `Baseline` for each line, which is the imaginary line on which most letters sit.\n",
    "\n",
    "- It fits Mathematical Curve `Spline` to the bottom of the blobs in a line to estimate the baseline.\n",
    "\n",
    "- This helps in recognizing letters that have parts going below the baseline, like `g`, `j`, `p` in English or `ज`, `घ`, `फ` in Nepali.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Phase 2: Recognizing Characters with LSTM**\n",
    "\n",
    "Once `Tesseract` has identified lines of text and their baselines i.e. `Image Segmentation` for that line, it moves to the `LSTM` based recognition phase.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Sliding Window Approach**\n",
    "\n",
    "Tesseract uses a `Sliding Window` approach to recognize characters. It takes small vertical slices of the line image and feeds them into the `LSTM` network.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Each slice is typically a few pixels wide and spans the full height of the line.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The `LSTM` processes these slices sequentially, maintaining a memory of previous slices to understand context.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **The Probability Output**\n",
    "\n",
    "For each slice, the `LSTM` outputs a probability distribution over all possible characters (including a special \"blank\" character).\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Slice 1`: 70% 'H', 20% 'A', 10% 'Blank'\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Slice 2`: 40% chance it's 'क', 30% chance it's 'ब'.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- `Slice 3`: 80% chance it's 'क'.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **CTC Decoding (Connectionist Temporal Classification)**\n",
    "\n",
    "The raw output is a messy streams like `H H A _ _ क क ब क _ _` \n",
    "\n",
    "where `_` represents the blank character.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `CTC` algorithm cleans this up by removing duplicates and blanks, resulting in the final recognized text.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Repeated characters are merged: `H H A` becomes `H A`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- It collapses blanks: `H A _ _` becomes `H A`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Confidence Scoring**\n",
    "\n",
    "Tesseract assigns a confidence score to each recognized character and the overall line based on the probabilities output by the `LSTM`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Higher confidence scores indicate more reliable recognition.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Phase 3: Post-Processing**\n",
    "\n",
    "After the `Neural Network` has recognized the text, Tesseract performs several post-processing steps to improve accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "`Tesseract` checks its work using the `Language Data Files` (`.traineddata` files) that contain dictionaries and language models.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Dictionary Lookup**\n",
    "\n",
    "Tesseract compares recognized words against its internal dictionaries to correct common OCR errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Tesseract` uses a `Directed Acyclic Word Graph (DAWG)` to efficiently store and look up words. It checks if the word `तपाईं` exists in the Nepali dictionary.\n",
    "\n",
    "- If the `LSTM` was 51% sure it saw `तपाईं` and 49% sure it saw `तपाई`, Tesseract will correct it to `तपाईं` based on the dictionary.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **N-Grams and Bigrams**\n",
    "\n",
    "It looks at word pairs. If `नेपाल सरकार` is a common bigram in Nepali, and the OCR output is `नेपाल ससरकार`, Tesseract might correct it to `नेपाल सरकार`."
